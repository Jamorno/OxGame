Objectives
- Daily Learning: Practice and enhance iOS development skills by completing a small project every day.
- Skill Development: Focus on different aspects of app development, including UI design, logic implementation, and architecture patterns.
- Portfolio Building: Accumulate a variety of projects to showcase creativity and technical expertise.
